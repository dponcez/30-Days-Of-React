# Conditional Rendering

#### What is conditional rendering?

Conditionl rendering is the way a condition is chosen, whether is true or false, in this way, we can use regular condition like <em>if</em> and <em>else</em>, <em>ternary operator</em>, ampersand (<em>&&</em>) operator to render <strong>JSX</strong> or <strong>Component</strong>.

#### How do you implement conditional rendering?

We can implement a conditional rendering using <em>if else</em>, ternary operator and ampersand (<em>&&</em>) operator, but most of the time we use ternary operator and ampersand (<em>&&</em>) operator.

In most cases ternary operator is the best way to implement a conditional.

#### Which method of conditional rendering do you prefer to use?

It depends, sometimes I use <em>if else</em> statement, but better than use if else, we can use a ternary operator, because allows us use it inside the styles or choose between components or JSX.
